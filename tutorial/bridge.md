# Bridge

Hadouken is natively integrated with Force Bridge, allowing you to bridge tokens to Godwoken from Nervos layer 1, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain.

Navigate to the [bridge](https://app.hadouken.finance/bridge) page, and choose the desired source chain. In this example, let's try Ethereum.

First, you will be prompted to switch network in MetaMask back to Ethereum. Then, let's say you want to bridge 100 USDC. Type 100 into the appropriate field, and click "deposit." You will first need to pay a transaction fee to let Hadouken access your USDC.

After confirming, wait a short while, then you will have another MetaMask prompt to confirm the actual bridge transaction.

Once the transaction has been confirmed by the Ethereum blockchain, you should see your balances reflected on Hadouken.
