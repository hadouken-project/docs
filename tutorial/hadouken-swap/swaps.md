# Swaps

Performing an asset swap on Hadouken will feel familiar if you've used Balancer, Curve, Uniswap, or another one of the popular decentralised exchanges available today. First, navigate to [Hadouken](https://app.hadouken.finance/), where you will be taken by default to the swap page.

One step that might seem unfamiliar involves initialising a Godwoken (Nervos layer 2) account.

Once you have sent at least 470 CKB to the address given by the prompt, click "create account" and wait a few minutes.

Once your layer 2 account has been created, you will be able to interact with the platform.

Head over to "swap" to perform a swap. Choose your desired source token from the dropdown, followed by your desired destination token. Instantly, you will see an estimate for the amount of tokens you will receive after the swap. Click "swap."

You should then receive one or two MetaMask prompts, which you should confirm. After the transaction has been verified on chain, you should see updated balance amounts. In this case, 200 CKB and 202.27 dCKB (having starting with 400 CKB).

Joining a liquidity pool is just as simple.
