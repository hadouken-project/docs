# Liquidity Pools

Head over to the "pools" page, where you will see a few different liquidity pools, their current rewards (in the form of trading fees), and volume.

Let's say we want to add liquidity to the goukenPool in the form of 100 CKB and 100 dCKB.

First, we navigate to the page in question, then scroll down and input the desired values into the appropriate fields.

Upon confirming the transaction(s) in the MetaMask popup(s), you should see "transfer pending."

Once the transaction has been verified by the blockchain, you will see your balances have updated. Note the 199.7 gouken\_LP tokens.

Withdrawing from a pool is just as easy. First, click "withdraw," then decide whether you want to receive one of the pool's tokens, the other of the pool's tokens, or an equal blend of both.

In this case, let's say I want to withdraw 100% of my liquidity, in CKB. In that case, I would receive 198.76 CKB (due to the pool's imbalance). However, if I choose dCKB, I receive 201.13 dCKB. Let's go with that.
