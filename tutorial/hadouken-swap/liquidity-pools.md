# Liquidity Pools

If you hover over the liquidity button on the navigation tab, click on the "pools" page, where you will see several different liquidity pools, their TVL, volume, and current APR (rewards in the form of trading fees, and in some cases, lending rewards).

Let's say we want to add liquidity to the USDC/USDT pool. First, click on that pool. You will see the pool's TVL, volume, 24h fees, and APR, as well as your balance in the pool. In this example, our wallet has over $400k in the pool, but we want to add more. Click invest on the right side of the screen.

You will be redirected to a page where you can input your desired investment amounts. In this case, let's deposit 200,000 of each token. (For weighted pools, you will be given an option to click "proportional suggestion" after inputting one amount, such that you can minimize price impact when entering a pool with multiple assets. This doesn't apply in this case.)

First, we navigate to the page in question, then scroll down and input the desired values into the appropriate fields. Then click preview.

On the ensuing prompt, you can review your summary total, and click invest. You will then receive a MetaMask popup (or, in some cases, multiple if you haven't already approved spend on Hadouken for each individual token).

Upon clicking confirm, you will wait a short while, then see that your transaction has confirmed.

If you wish to exit the pool, the process is similar. First, go back to the pool page, then click withdraw on the right side. You will be redirected to a page that looks like this.

By default, a proportional withdraw of each token is selected, with the assumption that the user wants to withdraw 30% of their position in the pool. However, if you click "all tokens," you can choose either USDC or USDT, if you wish to withdraw your LP token shares into a single asset. In this case, let's choose to receive a blend, but move the slider to 50%.

The amount of each token received upon exiting the pool is updated in real time as you move the slider. Once you've chosen 50%, click preview. You will see the approximate amount of tokens you should expect to receive, less any slippage.

Upon clicking withdraw, you will receive a MetaMask prompt. Click confirm, and you should have your tokens back shortly !
