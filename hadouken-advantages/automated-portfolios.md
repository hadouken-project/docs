# Automated Portfolios

## Modern Portfolio Theory

Nobel Prize-winning economist Harry Markowitz pioneered Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) in the mid-20th century. It is a set of principles that guides investors on how to choose investments that maximize returns while minimizing risk. The most fundamental concept in MPT is diversification, which means investing in a mix of assets with different characteristics and risks.

MPT assumes that investors are generally risk-averse, meaning they prefer portfolios with lower risks to those with higher risks, given the same expected returns. As a result, the average investor should invest in a portfolio of multiple asset classes. Markowitz's research showed that investors could achieve the best results by selecting the optimal balance of high and low-risk assets.

Another crucial aspect of MPT is automatic rebalancing. Market price fluctuations can alter the weightings of assets in a portfolio. Rebalancing is the process of restoring the portfolio to its desired allocation by selling assets that have gained value and buying those that have lost value. It is essentially a way of buying low and selling high.

Hadouken allows users to create, invest in, and manage portfolios with automatic rebalancing. For example, if a user sets up a portfolio with 1/3 of its value in ETH, 1/3 in CKB, and 1/3 in USDC, Hadouken incentivizes arbitragers to keep the three assets in that proportion. If the price of CKB goes up relative to ETH and USDC, the user will end up with slightly less CKB and more ETH and USDC. The best part is that, as a portfolio investor, you are paid for these rebalances rather than having to pay for them.

## Risk, Return, and Impermanent Loss

One potential downside to reduced portfolio risk is the possibility of impermanent loss. Impermanent loss is an inherent risk for liquidity pools, but on average, liquidity providers can expect lower volatility in their holdings. For example, a portfolio with a stablecoin and a volatile asset will show significantly reduced volatility in both upward and downward movements, even before considering income from fees and incentives.

To find out the quantifiable amount of impermanent loss that can be expected for a particular divergence in the prices of two coins, you can use this [IL calculator](https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/). The chart below illustrates how price changes can impact the amount of impermanent loss that a liquidity provider will experience for a given return on a token. For example, when a token increases 200% relative to the other one, the liquidity provider will incur an impermanent loss of around 5.72% compared to simply holding the two tokens.

It's important to understand impermanent loss in the context of portfolio management. While it can reduce overall returns, having a diversified portfolio of assets also reduces portfolio risk for long-term investors."
