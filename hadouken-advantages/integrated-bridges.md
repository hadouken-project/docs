# Integrated Bridges

Hadouken Bridge integrates with [Force Bridge](https://forcebridge.com/bridge/Ethereum/Nervos) to allow users to bridge funds over to Godwoken from Nervos Layer 1, Ethereum, or Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Hadouken skips the extra step of having to bridge from Nervos Layer 1 to Godwoken using the [Godwoken bridge](https://bridge.godwoken.io/#/v1/deposit/pending), and does it for you all in one step.

Further, utilising the Hadouken Bridge to bring funds over from Ethereum will both initiate the user's Godwoken account _and_ fund it with a nominal amount of CKB for fees. You don't need anything besides an Ethereum wallet connected to MetaMask, in order to get started on Hadouken ! Other bridges and chains will be supported in the future.&#x20;
