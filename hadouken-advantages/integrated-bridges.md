# Integrated Bridge

Hadouken integrates with [Force Bridge](https://forcebridge.com/bridge/Ethereum/Nervos) to allow users to bridge funds over to Godwoken from Nervos Layer 1, Ethereum, or Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Hadouken skips the extra step of bridging from Nervos Layer 1 to Godwoken using the [Godwoken bridge](https://bridge.godwoken.io/#/v1/deposit/pending) and does it for you all in one step.

Further, utilizing the Hadouken Bridge to bring funds over from Ethereum will initialize the user's Godwoken account and fund it with a nominal amount of CKB for fees. You don't need anything besides an Ethereum wallet connected to MetaMask to get started on Hadouken! Other bridges and chains will be supported in the future.&#x20;
