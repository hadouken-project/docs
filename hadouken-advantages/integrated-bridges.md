# Integrated Bridges

The goal with Hadouken is simple. A user should be able to come over from Ethereum with nothing more than a MetaMask wallet, and begin using Hadouken without the need for any new wallets, tools, or centralised exchanges. While this isn't currently possible - users still need a small amount of CKB to initialise their Godwoken (layer 2) accounts - we are getting closer and closer through the use of integrated bridges, starting with Force Bridge.

Natively on Hadouken is the Hadouken Bridge, which integrates with Force Bridge to allow users to bridge funds over to Godwoken from Nervos layer 1, Ethereum, or Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Other chains will be supported in the future.
