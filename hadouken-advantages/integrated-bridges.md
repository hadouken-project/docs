# Integrated Bridge

Hadouken integrates with [Force Bridge](https://forcebridge.com/bridge/Ethereum/Nervos) to allow users to bridge funds from Nervos Layer 1, Ethereum, or Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to Godwoken. Hadouken simplifies the process by skipping the extra step of using the [Godwoken bridge](https://bridge.godwoken.io/#/v1/deposit/pending) to transfer funds from Nervos Layer 1 to Godwoken.

Additionally, using the Hadouken Bridge to bring funds from Ethereum will initialize your Godwoken account and fund it with a small amount of CKB for fees. You only need an Ethereum wallet connected to MetaMask to get started on Hadouken. Other bridges and chains will be supported in the future.
