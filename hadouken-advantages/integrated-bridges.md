# Integrated Bridges

The goal with Hadouken is simple. A user should be able to come over from Ethereum with nothing more than a MetaMask wallet, and begin using Hadouken without the need for any new wallets, tools, or centralised exchanges. While this isn't currently possible because users still need a small amount of CKB to initialise their Godwoken (layer 2) accounts, we are getting closer and closer through the use of integrated bridges, starting with Force Bridge.

Natively on Hadouken is the Hadouken Bridge, which integrates with Force Bridge to allow users to bridge funds over to Godwoken from Nervos layer 1, Ethereum, or Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Other chains will be supported in the future.

Bridging assets from Ethereum will cost fees both in terms of gas, and in terms of the bridged token. For example, bridging USDC from Ethereum to Godwoken costs 4.82 USDC plus gas on the Ethereum network, though this gas cost at times can be as low as $1-2. Of course, during times of network congestion, this number will increase substantially.

Through integrations with Celer and Multichain, Hadouken allows for ease of interoperability between various different blockchains through methods other than Force Bridge.
