# Integrated Bridges

Hadouken Bridge integrates with [Force Bridge](https://forcebridge.com/bridge/Ethereum/Nervos) to allow users to bridge funds over to Godwoken from Nervos layer 1, Ethereum, or Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Hadouken skips the extra step of having to bridge from Nervos layer 1 to Godwoken using the [Godwoken bridge](https://bridge.godwoken.io/#/v1/deposit/pending), and does it for you all in one step.&#x20;

Further, utilising the Hadouken Bridge to bring funds over from Ethereum will both initiate the user's Godwoken account and fund it with a nominal amount of CKB for fees.

Other bridges and chains will be supported in the future.&#x20;
