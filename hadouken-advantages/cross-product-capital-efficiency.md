# Maximizing Capital Efficiency

Many DeFi products today have low utilization of deposited capital. For instance, only about 10% of the available liquidity in a typical UniSwap V2 AMM pool is used for trading. This is because trade sizes are typically smaller than the total available liquidity. The remaining 90% is essentially idle and not put to work.

Hadouken is designed to include a suite of DeFi products that work together with built-in mechanisms for optimizing capital efficiency. This ensures that idle capital is automatically put to productive use, resulting in higher yields for depositors.

For example, when you provide liquidity to a boosted liquidity pool on Hadouken, your tokens are automatically added to relevant pools on our lending platform. This amplifies your yield as a liquidity provider. Instead of letting your capital sit idle, you can earn double the returns using Hadouken - first, by providing liquidity, you are eligible for fees generated by traders, and second, you can earn lending returns through the lending protocol.

Hadouken has several built-in mechanisms for boosting capital efficiency:

1. Yield-boosted liquidity pools and investment portfolios lend out idle capital to lending reserves.
2. Yield-boosted liquidity pools provide alternative exit liquidity for lending and earn fees.
3. Backstop pools lend out idle capital to lending reserves.
4. Backstop pools provide crowdsourced liquidation capital for lending and earn liquidation rewards.
5. Liquidity pools provide rebalancing liquidity to backstop pools.
6. Backstop pools increase trading demand on trading liquidity to increase returns on investment portfolios.

We will continue to work on improving capital efficiency to generate organic yields for capital providers. Instead of relying on governance token emissions, we believe this is a more sustainable way to provide long-term value to our users.
