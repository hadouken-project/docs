# Maximizing Capital Efficiency

Today, most DeFi products have very low utilization of deposited capital. As an example, only less than 10% of the available liquidity in a UniSwap V2 like AMM pool is utilized as liquidity for traders, because typical trade sizes are much smaller than the total available liquidity. The remaining 90% is kept essentially idle and not put to work.

Hadouken is designed to include a suite of DeFi products that complement each other with built-in capital efficiency optimization mechanisms such that idle capital can be automatically put to productive use to boost yields available to depositors.

For example, when you provide liquidity to a lending boosted liquidity pool, your tokens are automatically added to the relevant pools on our lending platform, resulting in amplified yield for the liquidity provider. Rather than letting your capital sit idle, you essentially double dip on yields using Hadouken - first, by providing liquidity you are eligible for fees generated by traders on the platform. Next, you are eligible for lending returns through the lending protocol.

Here are all the capital efficiency boosting mechanisms built-in in Hadouken:

1. Yield-boosted liquidity pools and investment portfolios lend out idle capital to Lending Reserves
2. Yield-boosted liquidity pools provide alternative exit liquidity Lending Reserves and earn fees
3. Backstops lend out idle capital to Lending Reserves
4. Backstops provide crowd sourced liquidation capital to Lending and earn fees
5. Liquidity pools and investment portfolios provide rebalancing liquidity to backstop pools
6. Backstop pools increase trading demand on trading liquidity to increase return on the investment portfolios

We'll continue to work on optimizations on capital efficiency to generate yield for capital providers. Unlike other protocols that pump out high token emissions to attract capital, we see this as a critical path towards providing long term sustainable value to our users.
