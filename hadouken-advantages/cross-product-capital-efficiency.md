# Maximizing Capital Efficiency

Today, most Defi products have very low utilization of deposited capital. For example, only less than 10% of the available liquidity in a typical UniSwap V2 like AMM pool is utilized as trading liquidity. This is because typical trade sizes are much smaller than the total available liquidity. The remaining 90% is kept essentially idle and not put to work.

Hadouken is designed to include a suite of Defi products that complement each other with built-in capital efficiency optimization mechanisms such that idle capital can be automatically put to productive use to boost yields available to depositors.

For example, when you provide liquidity to a boosted liquidity pool, your tokens are automatically added to the relevant pools on our lending platform, resulting in amplified yield for the liquidity provider. Rather than letting your capital sit idle, you double dip on yields using Hadouken - first, by providing liquidity, you are eligible for fees generated by traders on the platform. Next, you are eligible for lending returns through the lending protocol.

Here are all the capital efficiency boosting mechanisms built-in in Hadouken:

1. Yield-boosted liquidity pools and investment portfolios lend out idle capital to Lending Reserves
2. Yield-boosted liquidity pools provide alternative exit liquidity for lending and earn fees
3. Backstops lend out idle capital to Lending Reserves
4. Backstops provide crowdsourced liquidation capital to Lending and earn liquidation rewards.
5. Liquidity pools and investment portfolios provide rebalancing liquidity to backstop pools
6. Backstop pools increase trading demand on trading liquidity to increase return on the investment portfolios

We'll continue working on capital efficiency optimizations to generate organic yield for capital providers. Instead of relying on governance token emission, we see this as a more sustainable way to provide long-term value to our users.
