# Introduction

Hadouken is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that offers a suite of products for trading, portfolio management, lending, and borrowing on the Nervos Network's Layer 2 Godwoken blockchain.

Built on top of Balancer and Aave, two of the most successful and proven protocols in the DeFi space, Hadouken brings top-class DeFi products to the Nervos ecosystem. We innovate in our mechanisms to maximize capital efficiency by moving idle liquidity to more productive use, resulting in higher returns for capital providers.

Our goal is to create a fair, community-driven, and long-term focused platform. Instead of aggressively pursuing growth at any cost, we take a measured approach and grow organically with our early supporters, while providing sustainable value.
