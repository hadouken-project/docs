# Introduction

Hadouken is a community-driven decentralized finance (Defi) protocol with a suite of products: trading, portfolio management, lending and borrowing built on Nervos Network's Layer 2 blockchain, Godwoken Game Plus.

Hadouken builds on top of Balancer v2 and Aave v2, two of the most successful and proven protocols to bring the best in class Defi products to the Nervos ecosystem. Hadouken is designed to maximize capital efficiency by utilizing its built-in mechanism to move idle liquidity to more productive use, boosting liquidity providers' overall return on capital.

Hadouken aims to be fair, community-driven, and built for the long run. Instead of providing aggressive incentives to grow at all costs, we take a deliberate and measured approach and grow organically with our early supporters, while providing sustainable value.
