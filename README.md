# Cross-Product Capital Efficiency

The reason for the marriage of a DEX with a lending platform boils down to capital efficiencies. With most other DEXes, the rewards for providing liquidity to various pools are limited to trading fees and emissions. The vast majority of farms simply result in high, short-term token emissions, followed by a quick token dump by "mercenary" LPs who go wherever the easy money is, and leave just as quickly as they joined. Or, even worse, after the platform raises capital from an ICO/IDO, users sell their tokens for a quick profit, the platform developer enjoys their quick pay day, and the platform dies a slow death. Hadouken doesn't do any of this.

Both centralised and decentralised platforms have their benefits. The vast majority of DeFi products suffer from capital inefficiencies due to the ways in which they work without the need for centralised platforms and counterparties. For example, token holders who provide liquidity into pools on decentralised exchanges (DEXes) earn a very small amount of trading fees from token swappers utilising the liquidity pools. To make up for this, most DeFi applications inflate their TVLs (total volume locked) early on by supplementing these trading fees with token emissions and hoping that "organic" TVL follows suit. Ostensibly, "mercenary LPs" - who will go anywhere to make a quick buck, but that's it - will join these high-yield LPs but leave as quickly as they arrived. In fact, the average liquidity pool sees more than half of mercenary LPs leave within 24 hours and 70% within three days.

Having both the DEX and the lending platform in one creates tremendous capital efficiency through the use of Hadouken Boosted Pools, which are like Balancer Boosted Pools. When you provide liquidity on our DEX, your tokens are automatically added to the relevant pools on our lending platform, resulting in amplified rewards for token holders. Rather than letting your capital sit idle, you essentially double dip on rewards using Hadouken. First, by providing liquidity you are eligible for fees generated by traders on the platform. Next, you are eligible for lending rewards through the lending protocol. But that's not all. In the future, they may be other methods for generating yield. Unlike other protocols that pump out high token emissions to attract LPs - who consistently leave after a short period of time - Hadouken takes advantage of capital efficiencies to generate attractive yet sustainable rewards for users.
