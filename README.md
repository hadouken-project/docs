### Introduction

Hadouken is a suite of DeFi products on Nervos Godwoken that enable users to trade, borrow, and lend a variety of cryptocurrencies. Aside from being the first stablecoin swap on Godwoken, Hadouken is also the first lending protocol where users can borrow against and lend their CKB.

Previously, holders of CKB were unable to unlock boosted rewards for their tokens. Using highly vetted codebases from projects such as Curve, Balancer, and Aave, Hadouken has brought several key DeFi products to Godwoken for the very first time.

First and foremost, Hadouken is community-driven. Join our Discord to interact with the team and stay up-to-date on future product iterations!
