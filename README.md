# Introduction

Hadouken is a community-driven decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol with a suite of products: trading, portfolio management, lending and borrowing built on Nervos Network's Layer 2 Godwoken blockchain.

Hadouken builds on top of Balancer and Aave, two of the most successful and proven protocols to bring the best in class DeFi products to the Nervos ecosystem. Hadouken innovates in its mechanisms to maximize capital efficiency by moving idle liquidity to more productive use, boosting liquidity providers' overall return on capital.

Hadouken aims to be fair, community-driven, and built for the long run. Instead of providing aggressive incentives to grow at all costs, we take a deliberate and measured approach and grow organically with our early supporters, while providing sustainable value.
