# FAQs

**Q: How do I report a problem or issue with Hadouken?**

A: Head over to our Discord, where a member of the team would be happy to assist.

**Q: Is there a HDK Token?**

A: Hadouken doesn't have a token now. We'll let our community know when that changes.

**Q: Since there's no token, where do yields come from?**

A: Yields for liquidity provision come from swap fees, which are displayed as an annualised percentage (APR) calculated from the last 24h of trading activity. For boosted pools, additional yields come from the proportion of underlying assets deposited to the lending contracts.
