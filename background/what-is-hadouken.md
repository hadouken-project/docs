# What is Hadouken

Hadouken is the premier decentralised finance application on Nervos Godwoken, enabling users to unlock more value for their crypto from various chains. Due to Godwoken's low transaction fees and fast transaction times, users can bridge coins over from a variety of blockchains (to start, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Cardano) to earn yield by providing liquidity, or lending out their tokens.

Unlike other projects that also decided to launch on Godwoken, Hadouken has had no IDO / token sale. Hadouken currently has no token, and incentives for participating in the protocol (e.g. liquidity provision, lending) are not currently boosted by token emissions. This may change in the future, but any design decision affecting the protocol will be made deliberately, without short-term financial gains kept in mind.
