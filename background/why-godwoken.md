# Why Godwoken

Nervos Godwoken is uniquely built for DeFi. With its fast block processing times, low fees, and ease of use, there's no better blockchain atop which to build Hadouken.

Godwoken is an EVM-compatible, optimistic rollup blockchain, built atop Nervos CKB (layer 1). It's a popular choice for application builders who want to take advantage of Ethereum's tooling, but without the downsides of high gas fees during times of network congestion.

Godwoken is only one of the many layer 2 implementations that can / do exist atop Nervos CKB. Layer 2 blocks are submitted to layer 1 in block submission transactions that generated CKB cells with cell data containing the current state of the Godwoken blockchain. As a result, fees are very low, and transactions are confirmed relatively quickly.
