# Why Pair The Two

When building Hadouken, we wanted to combine the top DeFi use cases together in a thoughtful way. The top DeFi applications by far (according to DeFi Pulse) are Maker - a lending protocol - and UniSwap - a decentralised exchange. It was clear that a compelling application would need to combine the two, in a mutually symbiotic way.

Through Hadouken Swap - proudly forked from Balancer, which we believe to be the best decentralised exchange in the industry - users can access deep liquidity for a variety of tokens from different chains. And for select tokens, users have the ability to "double dip" and earn boosted rewards by allowing their pooled tokens to also be deposited into Hadouken Lend.

Through Hadouken Lend - proudly forked from Aave, which we believe to be the best borrowing/lending protocol in the industry - users can for the first time access liquidity from their CKB without having to sell. In addition to borrowing/lending CKB, users can unlock liquidity for other staples such as BTC, ETH, and stablecoins such as USDC, DAI, and USDT.
