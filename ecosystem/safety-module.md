# Safety Module

Hadouken Lend needs a safety module, an “insurance fund” of sorts. Like with Aave, Hadouken Lend needs to give token holders an incentive to lock their eventual HDK tokens as the basis for a safety module. Aave gives 7%, but Hadouken may need to give slightly more, perhaps 10%. In the event of an attack on the protocol, token holders vote on whether to pay out affected users from the safety module, with a maximum withdrawal of 30% of the safety module. If this does not cover the extent of the damage caused by the attack, new tokens can be minted to cover the shortfall. For example, if the safety module has $100,000, and there is an attack resulting in $100,000 of lost user funds, only 30% of the safety module ($30,000) can go towards reparations, but $70,000 in new HDK tokens can be minted to cover the rest, as voted by token holders.
