# Audits

Hakouken uses Balancer V2's contracts without changes. Balancer's audits can be found [here](https://docs.balancer.fi/security/audits).

Hadouken uses Aave V2's contract with slight modifications to impose deposit and borrow caps for better risk control. We went through two audits on Hadouken Lending prior to the launch.
