# Audits

Hadouken uses the same contracts as Balancer V2 without making any changes. Balancer's audits can be found [here](https://docs.balancer.fi/security/audits).

Hadouken also uses Aave V2's contracts with slight modifications to impose deposit and borrow caps for better risk control. Hadouken Lending went through two audits prior to its launch.
