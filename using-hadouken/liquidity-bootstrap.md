# Liquidity Bootstrap

Hadouken offers users the ability to deploy their own pools using Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs), which use Balancer Smart Pools to allow controllers of the pool to change that pool's parameters in controlled ways. This makes it less trustless than a shared pool, but doesn't require the complete trust of a private pool. It allows token launchers to launch a token with low capital requirements by setting up a two-token pool with a project and a collateral token. The weights are initially set heavily in favor of the project token, but eventually flip to favor the collateral token by the end of the sale, for example beginning with 10-20% of a stablecoin and 80-90% of the bootstrapping token and ending with little to none of the bootstrapping token left. These types of pools also include optional features such as pausing swapping, which might be invoked to control the velocity of price changes shortly after launch.

Other optional features of LBPs that can be used to prevent undesirable side effects such as front-running include adding a high initial swap fee, and dropping it immediately thereafter. This way users that really want the token will still purchase early on (while paying the tax) but still get in at a better price than if front-runners were in play. LBP deployers can announce this fee change in advance. The possibilities go on and on. Ideally, at the "end of the sale" there should be a small balance of the project token and a large balance of the collateral token (e.g. USDC or USDT) in the pool. The pool deployer can then call _removeToken_ and "buy out" the other LPs.

There are many advantages of using a LBP to bootstrap a token sale. First, the sell pressure created by the market - mixed with modest trading volume - helps the token price generally approach the agreed-upon fair market price. Next, by starting with an intentionally high price, whales and bots are disincentivised from purchasing tokens early (unless they really want them, not just to flip as the price typically declines over time in a LBP sale). Next, starting capital can be small for bootstrapping and significantly more capital efficient than other token sale mechanisms. For example, running an LBP with _Token A_ and DAI, the bootstrapping team can begin with 10-20% DAI, as opposed to the 50% they might need if conducting the sale in another manner. Because LBPs use the math from Balancer's Weighted Pools, large disparities in the composition of the pool need not affect the price.

In the graphic above, the red line demonstrates price over time as dictated by the smart contract. At the launch, there are few buyers due to the high price. As the price slowly declines, traders step in and purchase the token. Arbitrage maintains this price for the duration of the LBP sale, as shown by the blue line. On the other hand, the green line shoes what happens when the initial price is too low. The asset gets bought up immediately upon launch, and the price then declines are no other buyers are willing to pay the same high price.

A popular platform for Fair Launch Auctions (FLAs) that enables individuals to create and use LBPs is [Copper](https://copperlaunch.com/), a crowdfunding mechanism that enables projects to raise money without barriers to entry.&#x20;
