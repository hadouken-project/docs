# Pools and Portfolios

Using automated rebalancing as described earlier like most DEXes, Hadouken is not a place for users to simply trade from one coin to another, leave, and never come back. Hadouken exists for users to invest over the long term in various different holdings as part of a well-balanced portfolio.

Because Hadouken is based on Balancer, it's extremely flexible in its use of liquidity pools. Unlike other protocols, Hadouken can accommodate pools of any composition. To start, the Hadouken team will determine which pools to support. However, in the future, users will be able to deploy their own pools.

Due to Hadouken's flexibility, pools can be deployed with high token counts, making them more like index funds. These pools allow users to have access to a broad variety of tokens. However, of course, the main difference lies with the fees. Instead of paying fees to rebalance one's portfolio - like with traditional finance - the pools collect fees as they're continuously rebalanced by traders performing swaps. High token count pools have the advantage of having many token trading pairs, resulting in additional opportunities to collect trading fees.

With this mechanism, the needs of both liquidity providers as well as traders are served. Liquidity providers collect trading fees while their portfolio is continuously rebalanced. And traders gain access to an open, decentralised exchange that never closes, allowing them to swap whatever they wish, for low fees.

Since Hadouken is non-custodial, your tokens belong to you. With several recent insolvency events involving centralised exchanges and yield-generating providers, there's no better time to use DeFi to manage your crypto finances in an easy way, with low fees and the utmost transparency.
